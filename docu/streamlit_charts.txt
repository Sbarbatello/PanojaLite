Graph 1: Line Chart for Net Worth Over Time: X-Axis: Time (e.g., months). Y-Axis: Total net worth. Chart Structure: A single line representing the total net worth at each point in time. Data Displayed: The sum of all asset balances for each month. Shape: A continuous line that shows the trend of your net worth over time, highlighting increases or decreases.

Graph 2: Stacked Area Chart for Asset Allocation Over Time: X-Axis: Time (e.g., months). Y-Axis: Value of assets. Chart Structure: Multiple stacked areas, each representing a different asset. Data Displayed: Individual asset balances stacked on top of each other to show both individual contributions and total net worth. Shape: Layers of color that cumulatively build up to the total net worth, showing how each asset contributes over time.

Graph 3: Heatmap for Monthly Changes: X-Axis: Time (e.g., months). Y-Axis: Different assets. Chart Structure: A grid where each cell represents the percentage change in an asset's balance from the previous month. Data Displayed: Percentage change values, with colors indicating magnitude and direction (e.g., green for growth, red for decline). Shape: A rectangular grid with varying colors that make it easy to spot significant changes.

Graph 4: Waterfall Chart for Monthly Changes in Net Worth: X-Axis: Time (e.g., months). Y-Axis: Change in net worth. Chart Structure: Bars that represent the monthly increase or decrease in net worth. Data Displayed: Starting balance, monthly gains/losses, and ending balance for each month. Shape: A series of bars that "step" up or down, showing how each month's changes contribute to the overall trend.

Graph 5: Correlation Matrix: Axes: Both axes list all assets. Chart Structure: A square matrix where each cell represents the correlation coefficient between two assets. Data Displayed: Correlation coefficients, with colors indicating strength and direction (e.g., blue for positive, red for negative). Shape: A symmetric grid where patterns can reveal relationships between asset movements.

Graph 6: Debt-to-Asset Ratio Visualization: X-Axis: Time (e.g., months). Y-Axis: Debt-to-asset ratio. Chart Structure: A line or bar chart showing the ratio over time. Data Displayed: The ratio of total liabilities to total assets for each month. Shape: A line or series of bars that indicate changes in financial leverage over time.
